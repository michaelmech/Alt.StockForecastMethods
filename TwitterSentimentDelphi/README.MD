This project aims to use the delphi technique by calculating the sentiment of over 25 expert fintwit accounts, and placing bets on the tickers that yield an overall agreement
from the average of sentiment scores. Appropriately, Black-Litterman portfolio allocation is suited to use expert sentiment scores as prior weights. Additionally, stop losses
and automated brokerage transactions are included. The delphi technique systematically takes the opinions of a panel of experts, and makes forecasts based on these opinions. The forecasts for the project are aimed at swing trading, so stock-based tweets for the most recent day from these experts' twitter accounts are used to make predictions for the next day.
